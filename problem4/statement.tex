Hunar is an ambitious runner who wants to become the next fastest man alive. He is participating in a circular race. Since Hunar is a resourceful person, he has already found out the top speed of each runner and calculated the time taken by them to complete one round. After how much time from the start will Hunar meet all other runners again at the starting point?

**Sample Example 1**  

Let $[10, 5, 15]$ be the time taken by each runner. They will meet again after $30$ seconds.

**Sample Example 2**  

Let $[4, 3, 7, 6]$ be the time taken by each runner. They will meet again after $84$ seconds.

**Input Format**  
The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of runners.  
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $T[i]$, the time taken by runner $i$ to complete one round.


**Constraints**  
$1 \leq N \leq 100$  
$1 \leq C[i] \leq 15$


**Output Format**  
An integer $M$ that denotes the time from the start until Hunar meets all other runners again at the starting point.
