Our SpyMaster Addzy has recently introduced us to a new game called Graph-fight. In this game, the opponent throws graphs at you. You get points if you catch Trees among these graphs, and you die if you get struck by a graph that is not a tree. 

He wants you to come up with an absolute plan to identify trees among the graphs thrown at you. You will be given $N$, the number of **vertices** in the incoming graph, and the **degree** of each vertex.

Find whether the graph is a tree or not.

**Note:** You can assume the graph is valid.

**Input Format**  
First line contains an integer $N$, the number of vertices.  
Second line contains $N$ space-separated integers, the degrees of the $N$ vertices.

**Constraints**  
$1 \leq N \leq 100$  
$1 \leq Degree[i] \leq 1000$

**Output Format**  
Print "Yes" (without the quotes) if the graph is a tree or "No" (without the quotes) otherwise.
